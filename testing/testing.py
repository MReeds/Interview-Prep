''' Convert above test to a unittest test case.
- Import unittest from the standard library
- Create a class called TestSum that inherits from the TestCase class
- Convert the test functions into methods by adding self as the first argument
- Change the assertions to use the self.assertEqual() method on the TestCase class
- Change the command-line entry point to call unittest.main() '''

# import unittest


# class TestSum(unittest.TestCase):

#    def test_sum(self):
#        self.assertEqual(sum([1, 2, 3]), 6, "Should be 6")

#    def test_sum_tuple(self):
#        self.assertEqual(sum((1, 2, 2)), 6, "Should be 6")

# if __name__ == '__main__':

''' pytest supports execution of unittest test cases. The real advantage of pytest comes
 by writing pytest test cases. pytest test cases are a series of functions in a
 Python file starting with the name test_.

pytest has some other great features:

Support for the built-in assert statement instead of using special self.assert*() methods
Support for filtering for test cases
Ability to rerun from the last failing test
An ecosystem of hundreds of plugins to extend the functionality
Writing the TestSum test case example for pytest would look like this: '''

# def test_sum():
#    assert sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6, "Should be 6"

# def test_sum_tuple():
#    assert sum((1, 2, 2)) == 6, "Should be 6"

''' Note: What if your application is a single script?

You can import any attributes of the script, such as classes, functions, 
and variables by using the built-in __import__() function. Instead of from my_sum import sum, you can write the following:

target = __import__("my_sum.py")
sum = target.sum

The benefit of using __import__() is that you donâ€™t have to turn your project folder into a package,
and you can specify the file name. This is also useful if your filename collides with any standard library packages. 
For example, math.py would collide with the math module.'''

''' unittest comes with lots of methods to assert on the values, types, and existence of variables. 
Here are some of the most commonly used methods: '''

# Method	Equivalent to
# .assertEqual(a, b)	    a == b
# .assertTrue(x)	        bool(x) is True
# .assertFalse(x)        bool(x) is False
# .assertIs(a, b)	       a is b
# .assertIsNone(x)	      x is None
# .assertIn(a, b)	       a in b
# .assertIsInstance(a, b)	isinstance(a, b)
